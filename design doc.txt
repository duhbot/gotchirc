Per-registered account, 1 gotchi
For a full day when first asking for a gotchi, get an egg
Egg is one of three possible gotchis
Each gotchi has two levels of evolution, two choices each time
Gotchi has three public stats and two invisible stats: hunger, cleanliness, play (happiness, xp)
Different gotchis have different stat amounts
Each stat that is at minimum reduces happiness, if all three stats >50%, increases happiness and xp
The closer some combination of the stats are to 100%, the faster happiness and xp increase (maybe x*y*z * some constant?)
Happiness is made visible only through some simple textual measurement (unhappy, neutral, happy)
XP made visible through an end-of-life level
Gotchi can end life either through miscare or natural causes after set amount of time
Happiness at 0% = death
Natural causes at two weeks real time
After death, user is given the choice to restart with a new gotchi starting at the level of the previous gotchi
Level is inherited from last gotchi, unused xp is lost
XP required for level (x) = x^2 * 20x + 35 or something

Interaction with gotchi is limited to four commands:
* Status: Returns quick status of gotchi, food/cleanliness/boredom (also gives age, starting level, name, and type of gotchi)
* Feed: Gives the gotchi one unit of hunger back
* Clean: Cleans up any poops around the gotchi
* Play: Asks player to solve a simple math problem to "play" with the gotchi (four function, single digit operands)

Stats are stored as int(current), int(max)
Decrements over time are done by timer to next decrement, stored as millisecond time when next decrement is scheduled
For food, one unit decrements every 2 hours
For cleanliness, one every 3
For play, one every 2.5
Happiness/XP update every 30 minutes

Happiness is adjusted (((x-0.5)*2)^2*((x-0.5)/abs(x-0.5)))*3 for x = each visible attribute
XP is gained at 10*((x-0.5)*2)^2 for x = each visible attribute if all x > 0.5
